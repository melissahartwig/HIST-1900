- [[The Six]] women where recruited to figure out how to program the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (the [[ENIAC]]).
- They worked as "computers," a clerical job that involved solving complex equations that would be used to build firing tables for guns. This war needed to help [[World War II]] battle efforts.
	- This was before there where numerus different types of programming languages.

- The women where highly trained mathmaticians, they where givin not bluprints, only logical diagrams of the machine.
- When advertisments for volenteers went out people did not know what the machine was for. Jean Jennings Bartik stated that she went in blind.

- When the machine was relaced to the public in 1946, there was no mention of women in the making of the technology.
	- Even when the women made the machine run effectivelt and invented modern programming their win was devalued.
	- The only people publically creditied for the project where John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert.

- The reason these women where almost forgotten in the history of technology is because at the time the majority of people did not understand programming and how significant it is to techology, but people understood the impressive nature of engineering the device.

**Connection**:
- [[The Six]] where almost erased from the history of tech much like [[Joseph Thompson (1893 - 2005)]] and his story.
	- In the tech indestry the only people who where valuded and portayed as contributing the most important work where white men. This is because there knowlage was never questioned by society.
- The technology developed by [[The Six]] was used to fight agenst the Nazi's, this is very similar to works by [[Alan Turing (1912 - 54)]] and [[Grace Hopper (1906 - 1992)]], both got into development and programming through war efforts.
