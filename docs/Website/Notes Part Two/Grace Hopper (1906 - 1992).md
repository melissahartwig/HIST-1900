- Grace Hopper was a computer pioneer and naval officer.
	- She received a master's degree in 1930 and in 1934 she got a Ph.D. in mathimatics from Yale.
- Being one of the first modern programmers, Hopper is known for her trailablazing contributions to the development of computer language.

- Hopper came from a privilaged family, she was educated in private school and her father was a Yale alumnie.
- During [[World War II]] many women where given oppertunities to join the workforce

- After the bombing of Pearl Harbor Hopper decided to join the war effort.
	- She was initially rejected because of her age and diminutive size.

- In December 1943, Hopper was able to join the U.S. Naval Reserve.
- She was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University.
	- There she worked with Howard Aiken, the person who developed IBM's Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator ([[Mark I]])
	- Hopper was responsibal for programming the [[Mark I]] and punching machine instructions onto tape.
	- Hopper wrote the 561-page user manual for the [[Mark I]].

- The Cold War shaped Hoppers career path.
	- Hopper worked in labs on topsecret calculations essential to the war effort.
		- Computing rocket trajectories, creating range tables for new anti-aircraft guns, and calibrating minesweepers.
	- During all this Hopper collaberated with others and created calculations for the army and 'ran numbers' used in developing the plutonium bamb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan.

- After the war Hopper became a research fellow in engineering sciences and applied physics.
	- She helped develop the [[Mark II]] and [[Mark III]] comuters
	- When working on the [[Mark II]] Hopper and a colleage found a problem. By taking apart the [[machine]] they found a moth. Hopper found the first technological 'bug'.

- After leaving Harvard in 1949 she joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation in Philadelphia as senior mathematician. The company, which was soon acquired by Remington [[Reminton Rand]], had developed the first electronic computer (the [[ENIAC]]) under army contracts.

- Hopper developed one of the first programming languages, called [[COBOL]], was introdused to the public in 1959
