Things to work on next: You don’t have source notes. You have notes on your sources; these notes are really your observations on your readings, the things you’ve drawn out of the work: thus, they should be your atomic/observation notes, with one major observation per note. **Your source notes need to have the full bibliographic citation on them, and then a precis or summary that functions rather similarly to what you might find in an annotated bibliography**. See the guidance on the course website about writing a precis/source note.  With regard to your index note, I was glad to see it there; now let’s improve it so that it becomes more useful for Future You. **Let it provide insight into the various pathways into your memex, why you ended up with the readings you did** (ie, rather like Martha Attridge Bufton’s recommendation about keeping a search log of not just what you found, but the search terms and databases that guided your search in the first place). See some of the other students’ public memexes for ideas here.
