- How do Alexas work?
	- Because the device is connected to the cloud it is able to learn and improve
	- Person asks question --> formed into text --> databasess are searched --> answer is than said by Alexa
	- Alexa learns with every question it is asked

	"With each interaction, Alexa is training to hear better, to interpret more precisely, to trigger actions that map to the userâ€™s commands more accurately, and to build a more complete model of their preferences, habits and desires"
	- Answering a query, turning on a light, or playing a music needs the use of a massive global network that is fuelled by the exploitation of non-renewable resources, labour, and data.

- Lithium is used to make Alexas
	- Lithium is used to create batteries but has a experation date. Once a lithium battery is used to its full compacity it is waist and can't be used again (creating polution)

- Extractivism --> the relationship between AI and the materials used to create it
